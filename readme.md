## Backend Stucture 

### Key Files and Their Roles

### 1. `controller.ts`
Handles external connections, requests, and responses. This is where the application's endpoints are defined, making it the entry point for processing incoming HTTP requests.

### 2. `service.ts`
Responsible for the business logic within the application. This layer processes data, applies business rules, and interacts with other layers, such as the database, to fulfill requests from the controllers.

### 3. `gateway.ts`
Manages WebSocket connections. This file is crucial for handling real-time communication between the client and server, enabling features like live updates and notifications.

### 4. `spec.ts`
Contains testing cases for the respective module. These files are used for writing unit and integration tests to verify that the applicationâ€™s code functions as expected.
